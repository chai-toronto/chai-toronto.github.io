  <h1>Overview</h1>
  <p>The Computational Health and Interaction (CHAI) lab is led by <a href="https://mariakakis.github.io">Prof. Alex Mariakakis</a> in the <a href="https://cs.toronto.edu/">Department of Computer Science</a> at the <a href="https://www.utoronto.ca/">University of Toronto</a>. We focus on using ubiquitous and emergent technologies like smartphones, wearables, and virtual reality to address problems related to people’s health and wellbeing. We develop new sensing technologies for measuring physiological, behavioral, and contextual health indicators, and we also take the time to understand the implications of these technologies in people’s hands. We proactively engage relevant stakeholders like clinicians, global health organizations, and industry to ensure that our designs are sensitive to their needs. Our group has expertise in multiple subareas of computer science, particularly machine learning, signal processing, computer vision, and human-computer interaction. We therefore publish our work at various international venues such as <a href="https://dl.acm.org/journal/imwut">IMWUT</a>, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/conference/chi">CHI</a>, and <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?reload=true&punumber=7756">PerCom</a>.</p>
  <!-- We also publish our work at digital health venues like <a href="https://www.nature.com/npjdigitalmed/">NPJ Digital Medicine</a> and <a href="https://mhealth.jmir.org/">JMIR mHealth & uHealth</a>. -->

  <h1>Examples of Ongoing Projects</h1>
  <p>Our work can be loosely split into three categories: <a href="#active">active sensing</a>, <a href="#passive">passive sensing</a>, and <a href="#design">design</a>. The projects listed below represent just a subset of our group's ongoing projects. For more information, please reach out to either the project leads or <a href="https://mariakakis.github.io">Prof. Alex Mariakakis</a> to learn more about these projects or any others.</p>
