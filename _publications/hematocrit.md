abstract: |
  Blood typing, donor compatibility testing, and hematocrit analysis are common tests that are important in many clinical applications, including those found in high-stakes settings such as the trauma center. These tests are typically performed in centralized laboratories with sample batching; the minutes that are lost in this mode can lead to adverse outcomes, especially for critical-care patients. As a step toward providing rapid results at the bedside, we developed a point-of-care hemagglutination system relying on digital microfluidics (DMF) and a unique, automated readout tool, droplet agglutination assessment using digital microfluidics (DAAD).
