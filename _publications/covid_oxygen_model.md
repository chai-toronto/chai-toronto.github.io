abstract: |
   The COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has placed the world in a state of emergency for the better part of two years. COVID-19 can range from being asymptomatic to causing potentially fatal complications, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome. Acute COVID-19 infections typically last for approximately 2 weeks and common symptoms include cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath. A warning sign of potential deterioration from COVID-19 used by healthcare practitioners is an objective decrease in oxygen saturation. In this work, we explore the prediction of low oxygen saturation in ambulatory patients with COVID-19.
