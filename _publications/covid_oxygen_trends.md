abstract: |
  The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Most patients with COVID-19 will have mild-moderate illness and can be managed at home, but a minority are hospitalized due to declining oxygen levels. Since objective hypoxia does not always result in subjective dyspnea in patients with COVID-19, some health care providers have used oxygen saturation monitors to monitor for worsening symptoms. Knowledge of oxygenation levels over the course of acute COVID-19 infection may help health care providers and patients know what to expect of COVID-19 infection and when they should seek further medical attention.
