abstract: |
  mcPHASES (<b>m</b>enstrual <b>c</b>ycle <b>P</b>hysiological, <b>H</b>ormonal, and <b>S</b>elf-Reported <b>E</b>vents and <b>S</b>ymptoms) is a comprehensive dataset consisting of multimodal physiological, hormonal, and self-reported measures collected to support holistic menstrual health research. Data from 42 Canadian young adult menstruators was collected across two 3-month periods. Participants wore Fitbit Sense smartwatches and Dexcom G6 continuous glucose monitors to measure physiological signals, and they used Mira Plus Starter Kits to track their hormone levels. Additionally, participants self-reported daily experiences like cramps, sleep quality, and stress levels. The dataset contains 23 structured tables organized by signal category so that researchers can examine relationships between physiological signals and hormonal fluctuations, analyze the impacts of lifestyle factors on the menstrual cycle, and develop better algorithms for menstrual cycle prediction. More broadly, mcPHASES supports research in women's health, digital health technologies, and personalized care by providing unprecedented multimodal data for building a more accurate understanding of menstrual health patterns.
