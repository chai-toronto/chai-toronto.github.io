    abstract = {Previous menstrual health literature highlights a variety of signals not included in existing menstrual trackers because they are either difficult to gather or are not typically associated with menstrual health. Since it has become increasingly convenient to collect biomarkers through wearables and other consumer-grade devices, our work examines how people incorporate unconventional signals (e.g., blood glucose levels, heart rate) into their understanding of menstrual health. In this paper, we describe a three-month-long study on fifty participants' experiences as they tracked their health using physiological sensors and daily diaries. We analyzed their experiences with both conventional and unconventional menstrual health signals through surveys and interviews conducted throughout the study. We delve into the various aspects of menstrual health that participants sought to affirm using unconventional signals, explore how these signals influenced their daily behaviors, and examine how multimodal menstrual tracking expanded their scope of menstrual health. Finally, we provide design recommendations for future multimodal menstrual trackers.},
