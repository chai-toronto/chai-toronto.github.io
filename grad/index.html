            <h2>Why should I consider doing research?</h2>
            <p>
                Getting involved in research provides you the opportunity to work on challenging projects and hone your skills.
                <br /><br />
                As a graduate student in a thesis-based Master's or PhD program, hands-on research experience is critical for career advancement.
                <br /><br />
                Working closely with faculty and peers will help you develop analytical, technical, and creative problem-solving skills.

Since most of our projects require clinical expertise, we also often collaborate with experts based in one of the 15 academic health organizations within the Toronto Academic Health Science Network (TAHSN). These include but are not limited to the University Health Network (UHN), Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre (Sunnybrook), and the Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids).">

Most lab members also have project-specific meetings with collaborators at various cadences. Beyond these scheduled events, Prof. Mariakakis makes intentional efforts to be reachable over various communication channels throughout the week (e.g., email, Slack, impromptu meetings).">

Research only gets appreciated when it is shared in a format that is easily understood by others, so demonstrating clear and effective writing (or a willingness to improve on such skills) would be beneficial.">

International students are strongly encouraged to consider applying to the PhD program.<br /><br />Domestic students: Students within Canada are strongly encouraged to apply to the Master's program even if they are interested in doing a PhD. If everything goes well and you are interested in continuing with the PhD, the transition into the PhD program is fairly seamless.">
