      <h2>Why should I consider the University of Toronto?</h2>
      <p>
        Our university is internationally renowned for its academic excellence, not just in computer science, but also in engineering, mathematics, and healthcare. The opportunity to work alongside experts from various domains in a highly collaborative environment is necessary for a topic like digital health where technical skills can only go so far. The presence of leading tech companies, startups, and other research institutions within the city also creates an ecosystem that encourages innovation. 
        <br /><br />
        As a city, Toronto is world-renown for its multiculturalism. There are activities and communities available to people from all walks of life. From festivals showcasing global cuisines to various cultural events throughout the year, Toronto offers a rich tapestry of experiences that promote inclusivity and cultural exchange.

          data-answer="Lab members are free to arrange their schedules as they please, although everyone is highly encouraged to physically be in the office for at least a couple of days per week to foster a lively and collaborative lab environment. We have periodic lunch meetings and outside social events as a group to celebrate each other's cultures and Toronto's amazing food scene.">

Since most of our projects require clinical expertise, we also often collaborate with experts based in one of the 15 academic health organizations within the Toronto Academic Health Science Network (<a href=&quot;https://tahsn.ca/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>TAHSN</a>). These include but are not limited to the University Health Network (<a href=&quot;https://www.uhn.ca/Research/pages/default.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>UHN</a>), Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre (<a href=&quot;https://research.sunnybrook.ca/about-sri/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>Sunnybrook</a>), and the Hospital for Sick Children (<a href=&quot;https://www.sickkids.ca/en/research/about-research-institute/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>SickKids</a>).">

Although he will do his best to respond to everyone, please bear in mind that he is more likely to promising candidates between June and October.<br /><br />Potential students must formally apply to the university in order to be considered for positions. Applications are typically due in late November or early December. Please refer to this <a href=&quot;https://web.cs.toronto.edu/graduate/prospective&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>page</a> for more information. When you apply, be sure to list Prof. Mariakakis as a potential supervisor of interest.">

          data-question="Is there anything I should know about applying to the University of Toronto specifically?"
          data-answer="Our department strongly suggests that prospective students without a Master's degree apply to different programs depending on their citizenship status:<br /><br /><b>International Students:</b> Because of how the University of Toronto structures student tuition, we are essentially unable to accept students from outside of Canada into our Master's program. International students are strongly encouraged to consider applying to the PhD program.<br /><br /><b>Domestic Students:</b> Students within Canada are strongly encouraged to apply to the Master's program even if they are interested in doing a PhD. If everything goes well and you are interested in continuing with the PhD, the transition into the PhD program is fairly seamless.">

          data-answer="Technical proficiency, critical thinking, and previous research experience are all important components that should definitely be highlighted in your application, but something that Prof. Mariakakis also values is academic writing. Research only gets appreciated when it is shared in a format that is easily understood by others, so demonstrating clear and effective writing (or a willingness to improve on such skills) would be beneficial.">
