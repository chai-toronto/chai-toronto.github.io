      <h2>Graduate Students</h2>
      <p>
        Prof. Mariakakis is actively looking for motivated people to join CHAI starting in Fall 2025. Priority will be given to students who are interested in using signal processing and machine learning on sensor data from ubiquitous devices (e.g., smartphones, wearables) to develop new digital health systems. However, students interested in qualitative methods in the context of digital health are also encouraged to apply. If you are interested, please email Prof. Mariakakis with a brief expression of interest and CV.
