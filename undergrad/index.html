            <h2>Why should I consider doing research?</h2>
            <p>
                Taking part in research gives you the chance to work on challenging problems without obvious solutions.
                <br /><br />
                If you are interested in pursuing graduate school (thesis-based Master's or PhD), research experience is increasingly important.
                <br /><br />
                Getting involved with research is an opportunity for you to flex your critical thinking, independence, and creativity.

We have had volunteers train machine learning models on sensor data, create new smartphone apps and browser plugins, and analyze transcripts from interviews. We have also had junior volunteers contribute to our research by helping with study coordination and data collection.">

                     data-answer="We generally do not recommend pursuing research if you have a heavy course load or a concurrent internship. We do not keep track of the amount of time people spend doing research, but the more time you spend doing research, the more likely you are to get something out of it. We use weekly mentor meetings to check that progress is being made at a reasonable rate. Note that in some cases, some volunteers may need to be available at specific times of the day to help with running user studies.">

We have projects that require expertise in data science, software development, and running user studies. As long as you have experience in one of those topics, or have the time and willingness to build that experience, we encourage you to apply.">

For example, showing that you built a smartphone app for a club or that you took the time to improve upon a course project before publishing it on GitHub are great ways of showing that you are willing to take initiative.">

Whenever we are in need of a research volunteer, we interview people who have filled out the form within the past 3-4 months to see if they would be a good fit. If the timing works out, these volunteer positions can be converted into research-for-credit courses (e.g., CSC 494/495). We also occasionally advertise openings through NSERC Undergraduate Student Research Awards (USRA) and University of Toronto Excellence Awards (UTEA), which offer funding support for students to do research over the summer. These positions are typically advertised well before the start of the summer, so keep an eye out for those emails from the Undergraduate Office.">
